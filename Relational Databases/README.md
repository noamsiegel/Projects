# Relational Databases
A relational database is a database that stores and provides access to related data points in one or more tables or relations. Each row is identified by a unique key and is also called a tuple, while columns are called attributes. The data is structured across multiple tables with pre-defined relationships. 

The files in this repo are some of the databases that I have built using Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, and more. Feel free to browse them to see how I think about relationships.
