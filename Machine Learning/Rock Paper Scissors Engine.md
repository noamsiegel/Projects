      <p">The well known game, but instead of random choices, player 2 (the engine) learns from your previous decisions to better its chances at winning. Over and and over again.</p>
      <p">This works by having a the program learn from previous user decisions to influence future engine decisions. For example, by constantly playing "rock" after "scissors", the algorithm will learn to always choose "paper" next after the user plays "scissors"</p>
