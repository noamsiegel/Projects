# Machine Learning
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn. 

It is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed, and involves understanding and building methods that "learn" from data to improve performance.
